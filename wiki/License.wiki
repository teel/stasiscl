This is a standard 2-clause BSD license. It's compatible with the GPL, as mentioned on [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html]:

 This is the original BSD license with the advertising clause and another clause removed. (It is also sometimes called the "2-clause BSD license".) It is a simple, permissive non-copyleft free software license, compatible with the GNU GPL.

The license, and a copyright statement, are present at the top of every source file.
